      <title>Cancer Costs: A Deep Learning Approach</title>

      <description>The aim of this project is to propose an effective neural network model to better predict end of life claim costs for terminal cancer patients in South Africa that improves on what traditional linear models can achieve for the task.
  Palliative care is a medical treatment approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems.</description>

      <title>Cluster Analysis for Portfolio Selection</title>

      <description>We implement a hierarchical risk parity portfolio (LdP2016) for assets to explore the use of cluster analysis for portfolio constructive and compare this with standard mean-variance methods.
  The data will be sourced from Bloomberg. We will attempt to combine the HRP portfolio with the mean-variance portfolio using the Historical Simulation with Flexible Probabilities (HS-FP) framework developed by Meucci(M2010).
  Theoretical Proficiencies:
Stochastic processes, optimization theory, portfolio theory</description>

      <description>This paper estimates the effect of old age pension on South African adult life satisfaction across four races, namely African, Coloured, Indian-Asian and White using the NIDS Wave 5 2017 dataset.
  Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the effect of explanatory variables on life satisfaction. The observed results are limited to the simplified techniques used in regression analysis.
  The paper finds receipt of pension to have an economically insignificant decrease in life satisfaction.</description>

      <description>Neural Networks provide a flexible basis for constructing non-linear models of real-world phenomena. Indeed, in recent times the model class has become an extremely popular tool amongst applied scientists owing both to its performance over a wide range of statistical tasks as well as the air of sentience that surrounds the internal functioning of the classâ€”the result of well chosen metaphors for describing the basic mathematical operations that define it.</description>
